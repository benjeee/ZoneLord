# ZoneLord

3D online multiplayer arcade small-battle-royale-like game made in Unity! Everyone's a little wizard that can turn invisible, shoot weird orange lightning from their little hands, shoot giant growing balls of lightning, and pick up limited-use abilities that affect the game in cool ways. There's a big cylindrical zone that moves around and shrinks every 90 seconds or so, and if you don't make it in you're dead. You get one life, last wizard alive wins.

Uses Unity's matchmaking system. Just have one player host and it should be listed on the match finder with whatever name they give the server, then anyone can hop on in.
